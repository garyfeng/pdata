## Conducting statistical significant tests ##

### Adjusting the p-value for multiple comparisons ###

In the following example, we have a data frame ```dfSceneDur``` with three variables, 

* ```sceneId``` indicates the scenes
* ```blockId``` marks the two conditions in this study
* ```dur``` is the duration of each scene

We wish to test if ```dur``` differs by condition in each scene. Given the number of multiple 
comparisons, we need to adjust the family significance level, e.g., using the Bonferroni method.

``` {r  eval=FALSE}
# do Wilcoxon for each scene
wilcoxRes <- dfSceneDur %>% 
  group_by(sceneId) %>% 
  do(w = wilcox.test(as.numeric(.$dur) ~ .$blockId, data=.)) 

# find out which scene is significant, with p.adjust()
wilcoxRes.sig <- NULL
for (i in 1:length(wilcoxRes$sceneId)) {
  # loop through all scenes
  scene<- wilcoxRes$sceneId[i]
  p<- wilcoxRes$w[i][[1]]$p.value
  if (p.adjust(p, n=length(wilcoxRes$sceneId), method="bonferroni")<0.05) {
    append(wilcoxRes.sig, 
           paste("Test is significant (with Bonferroni adjustment) for Scence='", scene, "', with p=", p))
  }
}

```

In generating the report, we can do something like 

```
There are `r '\x60r length(wilcoxRes.sig) \x60'` scenes showing significant 
difference after the Bonferroni adjustment: 
`r '\x60r print (wilcoxRes.sig) \x60'`
```
