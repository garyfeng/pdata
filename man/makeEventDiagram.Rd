\title{Generating a graph based on an input vector of states}
\usage{
makeEventDiagram(evt, nodeShapeBy = NA, graphName = "", ignoreRuns = F,
  excludeEdges = NA, excludeNodes = c(NA, "NA"), minimalEdgeCount = 0)
}
\arguments{
\item{evt}{A vector of events, which can be either numeric, char, or factor. The unique
values of the vector will become the nodes (unless excluded). Edges will be draw from
the current event to the next event (except those that are excluded).}

\item{nodeShapeBy}{A vector of distinct values, of the same length as evt, such that
event nodes with the same value of nodeShapeBy will have the same shape.}

\item{graphName}{The Name of the graph. This string will be printed at the top of the
output graph.}

\item{ignoreRuns}{FALSE by default. If TRUE, run-length-encoding will be done on the evt
vector, so that there are no self-referencial edges.}

\item{excludeEdges}{A logical vector the same longth as the events. If True, the edge
associated with corresponding event will not be drawn. NA by default.}

\item{minimalEdgeCount}{The minimal number of transition occurances before an edge is drawn.}

\item{excludedNodes}{A vector of names of the nodes to be excluded.}
}
\value{
a DiagrammeR graph object
}
